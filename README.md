# Recommender System

Part 1: SVD&SVD++
* Implemented SVD and [SVD++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)#SVD++) using Multiplicative update rules
* Used KL divergence and Euclidean distance to compute cost, respectively. 

Part 2: Movie Recommender

* Developed a recommender system based on the SVD++ algorithm to predict usersâ€™ preferences for unseen movies
based on their similarity to other users 

* The dataset contains 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies. Data Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
