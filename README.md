# Recommender System

SVD&SVD++.ipynb
* Implemented SVD and [SVD++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)#SVD++) using Multiplicative update rules
* Used KL divergence and Euclidean distance to compute cost, respectively. 

Movie Recommender.ipynb

* Developed a recommender system based on the SVD++ algorithm to predict usersâ€™ preferences for unseen movies
based on their similarity to other users 

* The dataset contains 100,000 ratings (1-5) and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. Data Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
